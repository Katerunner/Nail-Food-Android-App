## Nail Food Android App in Kotlin

This application was written according to a YouTube tutorial from the [UiLover Android](https://www.youtube.com/c/UiLoverAndroid) channel:

[âœ… Food App Android Design - how to make food ordering app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nWcPPHBzMk&t=8212s)

The difference from the tutorial is that most of the files (except TinyDB) are written in Kotlin, not Java. <br>
There are also differences in the Gradle build settings and several minor parameters, as the application was <br> 
tested on a higher version of Android (API 30, Android 11, R)
